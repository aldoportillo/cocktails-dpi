# Titos and Vodka
### An extension of [Neat on the Rocks](https://www.neatonthe.rocks/)

This project uses [The Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) API to search for cocktails.

This project helped me better understand calling an API using Ruby; as well as, creating actions, routes, and views.

This also gave me a better idea on how I would like to structure my Cocktail Database for Neat on the Rocks.
